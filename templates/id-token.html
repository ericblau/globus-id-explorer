        <p>Most OpenID Connect apps use the <b>ID Token</b> to identify individuals. 
           When you logged in, {{pagetitle}} received the following ID Token from Globus.  
           Explanations follow the data below. To learn how to correct this data, 
           <a href="{{explanationurl}}">click here</a>.</p>

        <pre>{{id_token}}</pre>

        <p>The ID Token typically includes the individual's name, email address, username, organization,
           and a <i>sub</i> (short for "subject"). 
           The <i>name</i>, <i>email</i>, and <i>organization</i> are provided by the individual when 
           he or she registers with the identity provider. If the identity provider doesn't report an 
           organization name, Globus asks you for it the first time you login using that identity 
           provider.</p>

        <p>The <i>sub</i> is generated by Globus.  Globus will never use the same sub for another 
           individual, and it will keep using the same sub for you even if you change your name, email 
           address, organization, or username. Each of your linked identities has its own unique sub.</p>

        <p>Globus ID Tokens include an <i>identity_provider</i> and an <i>identity_provider_display_name</i>.
           These tell us which of your linked identities was used for this ID Token.</p>

        <p>You may have several linked identities in Globus, but the ID Token can only have one.
           Globus normally fills your ID Token with data from your primary identity in Globus.
           However, if an app requires an identity from a specific organization, Globus will use 
           that identity instead. Either way, Globus remembers which identity it used, and will always 
           use the same identity for you in that app, even if you use a different linked identity to login
           when you return.</p>  

        <p>The <i>preferred_username</i> is contructed by Globus; it is the username reported by the 
           identity provider and the identity provider's primary domain. There is no guarantee that this 
           username won't be changed or won't be reused by a different individual later. (The <i>sub</i> 
           has those guarantees.) Although preferred_username looks like an email address, it may or may 
           not be a valid email address. Apps should use the <i>email</i> field instead.</p>

        <p class="note">Some identity providers&mdash;especially academic institutions and schools&mdash;report
           anonymized usernames to prevent misuse of your username. In the 
           preferred_username field, you might see a random string of numbers and letters 
           instead of your actual username. The same string will be used consistently every time 
           you login.</p>
